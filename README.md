# 2D Roguelike Tutorial - Reflections

Through completing the tutorial, I learned a lot about Unity's functions. Even though the structure is simple, it does make use of important functions in Unity such as coroutines, and uses inheritances. It is crucial to make use of the full arsenal of available tools so as not to repeat code. I also learnt about several functions of Unity that I hadn't known about before. For instance, I never knew you could lock the inspector.

The video also used a lot of other shortcuts. For instance, other tutorials I had seen before had never used Invoke, so I never knew that it could save a lot of lines of code by replacing a coroutine. I had also never used Animator Override Controller before.

Even though I have been using Unity for a long time, I was able to learn about features that could save a lot of time in game development. Since the compiling and loading time to test even small changes in code can get pretty steep, it's important to take advantage of any provided shortcuts.

But optimising development process is one thing. The end product must also stand out, and that depends on how you use the tools to your advantage. Anyone can follow the tutorial and make the exact same game. As I tested the game, I felt that it was missing a crucial mechanic - which is the player being able to attack enemies. So, I added that as a bonus feature. I also added a kill counter, which could be expanded upon for other features.

I had other ideas which I would continue to add, if this project was to be expanded: an experience system to reward fighting enemies, a shop to buy cosmetic or weapon upgrades, and a boss battle every few levels to increase variety.

Lastly, a good game's success still depends on howw many people play it. Hence, I decided to make a simple gameplay video to market the game better.
