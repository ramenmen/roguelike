# 2D Roguelike Tutorial - Reflections

Through completing the tutorial, I learned a lot about Unity's functions. Even though the structure of the project is simple, it does make use of important functions in Unity such as coroutines, and uses inheritances. For me, it cemented the fact that it's crucial to make use of the full arsenal of available tools so as not to repeat code. I also learnt about several functions of Unity that I hadn't known about before. For instance, I never knew you could lock the inspector.

I also used Animator Override Controller for the first time, and learnt about many shortcuts that can increase my efficiency. For instance, other tutorials I had seen before had never used Invoke, so I never knew that it could save a lot of lines of code by replacing a coroutine. These can speed up the game development process a lot, and I will definitely research more features of Unity for future projects. 

Even though I have been using Unity for a long time, I was able to learn about features that could save a lot of time in game development. Since the compiling and loading time to test even small changes in code can get pretty steep, it's important to take advantage of any provided shortcuts.

But the end product must also stand out, in addition to optimising the development process. Having a memorable end product depends on how you use the tools to your advantage. Anyone can follow the tutorial and make the exact same game. As I tested the game, I felt that it was missing a crucial mechanic - which is the player being able to attack enemies. So, I added that as a bonus feature. I also added a kill counter, which could be expanded upon for other features.

I had other ideas which I would continue to add, if this project was to be expanded: an experience system to reward fighting enemies, a shop to buy cosmetic or weapon upgrades, and a boss battle every few levels to increase variety.

Lastly, a good game's success still depends on how many people play it. Hence, I decided to make a simple gameplay video to market the game better. I've learned a surprising amount from this small project, and am excited to apply my new ideas to future projects.
